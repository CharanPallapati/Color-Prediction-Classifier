# Color-Prediction-Classifier
This project is a sophisticated color prediction classifier designed to recognize and categorize the dominant color in input images. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, this classifier ensures accurate identification and labeling of primary colors. The project utilizes libraries such as OpenCV for image processing and scikit-learn for machine learning. The classifier is deployed as a web application using Flask, allowing users to upload images and receive real-time color classification results.

The core functionality of the classifier involves reading and processing the input image, resizing it to a standard dimension, and flattening it into a feature vector. The pre-trained machine learning model then predicts the dominant color based on the extracted features. The model has been trained on a diverse dataset of images to ensure high accuracy and robustness.
